# Traffic-Cone Film Scanning: High-Quality Digitization on the Cheap

Analog photography is making a resurgence, many people are shooting film again.

To view and share the photos, they need to be digitized.

Scanning using a digital camera is popular, but a conventional setup can cost [hundreds of dollars](photos/dollaz.png).

TCFS is a low-cost 3D-printable alternative that delivers high-quality results at a fraction of the price.

## How It Works

* Print a cone
* Attach to lens hood
* Lens hood on macro lens
* Film flat under glass
* Camera points straight down
* Focus and shoot!

## Advantages

* **Low cost**: $5 in filaments, $60 all-in.
* **Space-saving**: No tripods or copystands.
* **No calibration**: Fixed distance, always square, no fiddling.
* **Multi format**: 126, 35mm, 645, 6x6, 6x7, 6x9, sprockets, and more!

## Samples

Fuji XT4 + Laowa 65mm f/2.8

â†‘ The white specks are from film expiration, not dust!!1

Anyway, as you can see, the results speak for themselves!

## So What's the Catch?

It's not a turn-key solution. You need to be a bit handy:

* Basic DIY skills: Wire a plug, using a caliper, etc.

* Access to 3D printer (Your own / local library / makerspace)

* Know basics of 3D printing (or have someone do it for you)

## Parts

Interested? Let's get started!

The setup involves:

* Light Table
* Macro Lens
* Flat Glass
* The Cone

### Light table

A bright and even light source is needed to illuminate the film from behind.

You can spend a lot on the usual suspects that sponsor Youtube videos.

Instead, I recommend getting a **High-CRI LED Panel Light** for office ceilings:

They are a lot cheaper, and give you a massive area to work with.

Of course, there are smaller size too, just make sure it is high-CRI.

### Macro Lens

Obviously, the quality of the scan depends largely on the lens.

For best results, I would recommend:

* A proper **macro lens**
* With **internal focusing** (front element doesn't move)
* Can take thread-mount (or bayonet-mount) lens hood

I use [Laowa 65mm f/2.8 2x Ultra Macro APO](https://www.venuslens.net/product/laowa-65mm-f-2-8-2x-ultra-macro-apo/).

It seems to be very well reviewed:

* 2x magnification
* Great image quality
* Already popular with film digitization
* Good value for money
* **Ready-to-print** cones!

Around $340 on Aliexpress, $380 from other sources with faster shipping.

Many **vintage lens** are good candidates too, and can be a lot cheaper.

However, you need to do your own homework.

Search `Film scanning macro lens` on google.

[This article has a fairly extensive tier list](https://web.archive.org/web/20240206003914/https://www.pixl-latr.com/how-good-a-macro-lens-do-you-really-need-for-dslr-mirrorless-camera-scanning/).

### Flat Glass

We also need a piece of glass to hold the film flat on the light table.

* Around 2mm thickness
* At least 8x10 in size
* I got mine from a cheap picture frame
* Make sure it's **glass** NOT acrylic

There are also fancy variants such as etched or low-reflection glasses, but I did just fine with the regular kind.

#### OMG what about newton rings???????///

We'll scan with emulsion (matte) side up.

## Printing the Traffic Cone

With everything else sorted, it's time to print a traffic cone for your lens, and a specific film format.



### I have the Laowa 65mm f/2.8!

Great! 

35mm
6x9

### I'm using some other lens!

take a look at this article to customize the cone to your specific lens
