# Traffic-Cone Film Scanning: High-Quality Digitization on the Cheap

Analog photography is making a resurgence, many people are shooting film again.

To view and share the photos, they need to be digitized.

Scanning using a digital camera is popular, but a conventional setup can cost [hundreds of dollars](photos/dollaz.png).

TCFS is a low-cost 3D-printable alternative that produces high-quality results at a fraction of the price.

## How It Works

* Print a cone
* Attach to lens hood
* Attach to macro lens
* Film under glass
* Camera on cone, pointing straight down.
* Focus and shoot!

## Advantages

* **Low cost**: $1 in filaments, $50 all-in.
* **Space-saving**: No tripods or copystands.
* **No calibration**: Fixed distance, always square.
* **Fully enclosed**: No stray lights, no reflection.
* **Multi format**: 110, 126, 35mm, 645, 6x6, 6x7, 6x9, sprockets, and more!

## Samples

Suffice to say, the results speak for themselves!

## So What's the Catch?

This is not a turn-key solution.

For most cost effectiveness, you need to be a bit handy:

* Basic DIY skills: Wire a plug, using a caliper, etc.
* Access to 3D printer (Your own / local library / makerspace)
* Know basics of 3D printing (or have someone do it for you)

## Sounds Great, I'm In!

Let's get started! The setup involves:

* Macro Lens
* Lens Hood
* Light Table
* Flat Glass
* The Cone

## Macro Lens

Obviously, the quality of the scan largely depends on the lens.

For best results, I recommend:

* A proper **macro lens**
* With **internal focusing** (front element doesn't move)

---------

**Magnification Ratio** is an important factor to consider.

* A 1:1 (1x) ratio means the lens can project the **actual size of the subject** onto the sensor
* At 2:1 (2x), the subject can be projected **twice as big** on the sensor
* Therefore, a decent MR is useful for smaller formats (35mm and under).

-------

You can always drop 4 figures on a flagship first-party lens, but for film scanning it's a bit overkill.

Personally I use [Laowa 65mm f/2.8 2x Ultra Macro APO](https://www.venuslens.net/product/laowa-65mm-f-2-8-2x-ultra-macro-apo/).

* 2x MR
* Superb image quality
* **Ready-to-print** cones!
* Around $330

Another popular option is [7Artisans 60mm f/2.8 Mark II](https://7artisans.store/products/7artisans-60mm-f2-8-mark-ii-macro-lens-for-sony-e-fuji-fx-canon-eos-m-olympus-m43-nikon-z-mirrorless-cameras).

* 1x MR
* Excellent image quality
* Around $160

Both are fully manual and popular with film digitization.

Get them cheaper on ebay or aliexpress.

The extra magnification of laowa can be handy for subminiature formats such as 110, half-frame, or disk films.

-----------------

Many **vintage lenses** are good candidates too, and can be even cheaper.

However, you need to do your own homework. Search `Film scan macro lens` on google.

[This article has a fairly extensive tier list](https://web.archive.org/web/20240206003914/https://www.pixl-latr.com/how-good-a-macro-lens-do-you-really-need-for-dslr-mirrorless-camera-scanning/).

## Lens Hood

We need a lens hood to attach the cone to.

* Fits your lens
* **Circular** shape
* **Fully enclosed**
* One-piece **metal** (not collapsible)
* Not too tall

Just get the cheapest from ebay or aliexpress, they are all the same.

## Light Table

A bright and even light source is needed to illuminate the film from behind.

You can spend a lot on the usual suspects that sponsor Youtube videos.

Instead, I recommend getting a **LED Light Panel** for office ceilings.

They are a lot cheaper, and give you a massive area to work with.

![Alt text](photos/panel.png)

* Make sure it's **High-CRI** (>95)

* Neutral color temperature (**Around 5000K**)

* Flat matte surface finish (pretty sure they all are)

* Standard size is 600x600mm / 24x24in 

* Smaller ones available, but I like it big!

![Alt text](photos/space.jpeg)

The LED panel comes with a power adapter, into which you need to wire up a plug.

⚠️ ⚡ Mains voltage is involved! 

⚠️ ⚡ Make sure you know what you're doing!

⚠️ ⚡ Look up how to wire a plug in your country.

![Alt text](photos/psu.jpg)

Generally:

* Brown is **LIVE**
* Blue is **NEUTRAL**
* Green/Yellow is **EARTH**

You can use a regular plug and turn it on/off at the power strip.

Or an inline switch like this to be extra fancy!

![Alt text](photos/sw.jpg)

* Remember to **twist-lock** the output jack so it stays in place

## Flat Glass

We need a piece of glass to hold the film flat on the light table.

* Around 2mm thickness
* At least 8x10 in size, mine is 11x14.
* Make sure it's **glass** NOT acrylic
* I got mine from a picture frame at a thrift store

![Alt text](photos/frame.jpg)

#### OMG what about newton rings???????

We scan with emulsion side up, along with the setup I'm going to cover later, seems to helps a lot.

I suggest starting with cheap plain glass, you can always upgrade to ANR glass down the line.

## Cone Preparation

For best results, the cone should be adjusted to your specific lens / film format combo.

### I bought one ready-made!

Great, [skip to the next section](#assembling-the-cone).

## Printing the Cone

Now you have the model, time to print it!

If you don't have a 3D printer, try local library, makerspace, or online printing services.

* Use **opaque black** filament, PLA works just fine.
* Around 10-20% infill
* Very simple design, turn up the speed if you want.

2 hours later, voilà:

![Alt text](photos/voila.jpeg)

* Wait for the bed to cool down before removing.
* Double check the base is **completely flat**.
* It **must not** wobble when placed on flat surface.
* If warped, improve bed adhesion. Re-level, hairspray, raft, etc.
* Remove any loose strands of stringing/hair/whiskers near the film gate.

## Cone Assembly

* First, remove filament whiskers **near the film gate**, if any.
* Whiskers higher up won't show up, no need to worry about them.

-----

* Put the cone on the light table
* Attach the lens hood to your lens, moderately tight

![Alt text](photos/.jpeg)

* Hover the camera **just above** the cone, adjust focus
* Until the film gate is **parallel** with camera frame

![Alt text](photos/.jpeg)

* Lower and **loosely** rest the camera on the cone, **DO NOT** push all the way in yet!
* Double check the framing is still straight
* Mark the position of the cone with paint marker, or a scratch mark.

![Alt text](photos/.jpeg)

* Unscrew the lens hood
* Rest the cone on a flat surface (**NOT LIGHT TABLE**)
* Make sure the position mark is still aligned
* Push the lens hood all the way in
* Make sure it **bottoms out** and **flat and level**

![Alt text](photos/.jpeg)

The cone should grip the lens hood tightly. 

If too loose, adjust the parameters and print a new one, or just fill the gap with superglue.

## Scanning Prerequisites

The cone is ready! But before start scanning, we need to set up a few things.

### Light Panel

Put the light table on a flat surface.

If the power jack sticks out, let it hang off the edge. Double check it is **twist-locked**.

![Alt text](photos/.jpeg)

The panel should be flat and not wobble.

### White Balance

Set a **custom white balance** to your light table.

Usually involves taking a picture of the blank table. Look up camera user manual.

### RAW Output

Select RAW output format for best quality, needed for most converting software.

![Alt text](photos/.jpeg)

### Dust Management

We have many potential surfaces for dust (table, film, glass), so it is crucial to be as clean as possible.

#### WEAR GLOVES

* **DO NOT** touch film / glass with bare hands!
* I use disposable gloves, reusable gloves works too, but they might shed lints.

#### Wipe-down

* Get some **Chamois Leather**. Inexpensive, but make sure it's real.
* Microfibre cloths works too, but they might also shed lints. 
* Before a scanning session, wipe clean the light table and glass (both sides).

## Scanning Procedures

* Attach cone to the camera by screwing on the lens hood.

* Wear gloves, wipe down the glass and light table with chamois leather to reduce dust.

* Place film strips **emulsion side up** near the **center** of the light table.

	* Looking down, the picture/frame-number should **look mirrored**.

* Place glass on top.



place camera over the negative.

focus, focus assist, peaking with magnification absolutly essential. very littlemargin for error. look for where the assist it strongest.

aparture: very important. around F8, wide open lower image quality harder to focus. too small diffraction makes it blurry.

ISO: reduce noise, as low as possible, anything below 200 is plenty.

exposure, not too sure, center weighted autoexposure close enough.

make sure use RAW format

short self timer with remote release

change all the settings before focusing. once in focus touch as little as possible.

move the whole thing around the glass.

## Tips and Tricks

checklist

white balance correct?
ISO as small as possible
