## So What's the Catch?

It's not an off-the-shelf product, so you need to be a bit handy:

* Basic DIY skills: Wire up a plug, measure with a caliper, etc.

* Access to 3D printer (Your own / local library / makerspace)

* Know basics of 3D printing (or have someone do it for you)

#### Light table

You can spend hundreds on a specialty film scanning light from the usual suspects that sponsor Youtube videos.

However, my recommendation is getting a **High-CRI LED Panel Light** for office ceilings.
