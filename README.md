# Traffic-Cone Film Scanning: High-Quality Digitization on the Cheap

Analog photography is making a resurgence, many people are shooting film again.

To view and share the photos, they need to be digitized.

Scanning using a digital camera is popular, but a conventional setup can cost [hundreds of dollars](photos/dollaz.png).

TCFS is a low-cost 3D-printable alternative that produces high-quality results at a fraction of the price.

## How It Works

* Print a cone
* Attach to lens hood
* Lens hood on macro lens
* Film flat under glass
* Camera points straight down
* Focus and shoot!

## Advantages

* **Low cost**: $1 in filaments, $50 all-in.
* **Space-saving**: No tripods or copystands.
* **No calibration**: Fixed distance, always square, no fiddling.
* **Multi format**: 110, 126, 35mm, 645, 6x6, 6x7, 6x9, sprockets, and more!

## Samples

Fuji XT4 + Laowa 65mm f/2.8

â†‘ The white specks are from film expiration, not dust!!1

Anyway, as you can see, the results speak for themselves!

## So What's the Catch?

This is not a turn-key solution. You need to be a bit handy:

* Basic DIY skills: Wire a plug, using a caliper, etc.

* Access to 3D printer (Your own / local library / makerspace)

* Know basics of 3D printing (or have someone do it for you)

## Parts

Interested? Let's get started!

The setup involves:

* Light Table
* Macro Lens
* Lens Hood
* Flat Glass
* The Cone

## Light table

A bright and even light source is needed to illuminate the film from behind.

You can spend a lot on the usual suspects that sponsor Youtube videos.

Instead, I recommend getting a **LED Light Panel** for office ceilings.

They are a lot cheaper, and give you a massive area to work with.

* Make sure it's **High-CRI** (>95)

* Neutral color temperature (**Around 5000K**)

* Standard size is 600x600mm / 24x24in 

* Half-size ones available, but I like it big!

## Macro Lens

Obviously, the quality of the scan is largely dictated by the lens.

For best results, I would recommend:

* A proper **macro lens**
* With **internal focusing** (front element doesn't move)

**Magnification Ratio** is an important factor to consider.

* A 1:1 (1x) ratio means the lens can project the **actual size of the subject** onto the sensor
* At 2:1 (2x), the subject can be projected **twice as big** on the sensor
* Therefore, a decent MR is helpful for scanning smaller formats (35mm and under).

-------

You can always drop 4 figures on a flagship first-party lens, but for film scanning it's a bit overkill.


I personally use [Laowa 65mm f/2.8 2x Ultra Macro APO](https://www.venuslens.net/product/laowa-65mm-f-2-8-2x-ultra-macro-apo/).

* 2x MR
* Superb image quality
* **Ready-to-print** cones!
* Around $350

Another popular option is [7Artisans 60mm f/2.8 Mark II](https://7artisans.store/products/7artisans-60mm-f2-8-mark-ii-macro-lens-for-sony-e-fuji-fx-canon-eos-m-olympus-m43-nikon-z-mirrorless-cameras)

* 1x MR
* Excellent image quality
* Around $160

Both are fully manual and popular with film digitization.

The extra magnification of laowa can be handy for subminiature formats such as 110, 16mm, or disk films.

-----------------

Many **vintage lens** are good candidates too, and can be even cheaper.

However, you need to do your own homework.

Search `Film scanning macro lens` on google.

[This article has a fairly extensive tier list](https://web.archive.org/web/20240206003914/https://www.pixl-latr.com/how-good-a-macro-lens-do-you-really-need-for-dslr-mirrorless-camera-scanning/).

## Lens Hood

We also need a lens hood to attach the cone to.

* Same diameter as your lens
* **Circular** shape
* **Fully enclosed**
* One-piece **metal** (not collapsible)
* Not too tall

Just get the cheapest from ebay or aliexpress, they are all the same.

## Flat Glass

We need a piece of glass to hold the film flat on the light table.

* Around 2mm thickness
* At least 8x10 in size
* Make sure it's **glass** NOT acrylic
* I got mine from a cheap picture frame

#### But what about newton rings???????

We scan with emulsion/matte/curled side up, and that seems to do the job.

I would suggest start with cheap plain glass, you can always upgrade to ANR glass down the line.

## Printing the Traffic Cone

With everything else sorted, it's time to print a traffic cone for your lens!

### I have the Laowa 65mm f/2.8!

Great! 

Download the STL files

35mm
6x6
6x7
6x9

bottom plate dimension should be 90x90mm

### I'm using some other lens!

take a look at this article to customize the cone to your specific lens.

Load up the model in your slicer. It should be very easy to print, so don't be afraid to turn up the speed.
